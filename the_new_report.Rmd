This is my report, it will have stuff.
Examples:

**This is what happens when I use 2 asterisks**

_This is what happens when I use underscores_

This list has bullets:

* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3

in between the lines there has to be a blank line so there is a linebreak

```{r load_data}
gapminder <- read.csv("./data/gapminder_data.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(pop_millions = pop / 10^6) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_pop_millions = mean(pop_millions)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = mean_pop_millions)) + geom_point()

ggplot(data = gapminder,
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = continent), alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", se = 0.9999, size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  labs(
    x = "GDP per Capita", 
    y = "Life Expectancy", 
    title = "Figure 1",
    color = "Continent"
    ) + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

```
